# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hi, I'm Fernando, a bartender by trade and a coder by passion. I'm excited to share my projects and ideas with you, and I hope you'll join me on this journey to create innovative solutions that enhance lives.

## About Me

As a bartender, I've learned the importance of creativity, attention to detail, and communication. As a coder, I've discovered the power of technology to transform lives. My goal is to combine these skills to create something truly unique: a "cheatsheet to life" through code.

## My Mission

I believe that AI should be open and beneficial for all. I'm committed to developing solutions that are transparent, accessible, and empowering. Whether it's a tool to simplify daily tasks or a platform to connect people, I'm passionate about using code to make a positive impact.

## Explore My Projects

Take a look at my repositories to see what I'm working on:

* **Project 1: AI-Powered Cocktail Recipes** - A machine learning model that generates unique cocktail recipes based on flavor profiles and ingredients.
* **Project 2: Life Hacks Chatbot** - A conversational AI that provides helpful tips and advice on everyday tasks and challenges.
* **Project 3: Community Forum** - A platform for people to connect, share ideas, and collaborate on projects.

## Interactive Fun

Want to get a taste of my coding skills? Try out this interactive cocktail recipe generator:

```html
<html>
  <div id="cocktail-recipe">
    <h2>Generate a Random Cocktail Recipe!</h2>
    <button id="generate-recipe">Shake It Up!</button>
    <div id="recipe-output"></div>

    <script>
      const generateRecipe = () => {
        const ingredients = ["gin", "vodka", "rum", "tequila", "whiskey"];
        const mixers = ["tonic", "soda", "juice", "cream", "syrup"];
        const garnishes = ["lime", "lemon", "orange", "cherry", "olive"];

        const randomIngredient = ingredients[Math.floor(Math.random() * ingredients.length)];
        const randomMixer = mixers[Math.floor(Math.random() * mixers.length)];
        const randomGarnish = garnishes[Math.floor(Math.random() * garnishes.length)];

        const recipe = `Mix ${randomIngredient} with ${randomMixer} and garnish with ${randomGarnish}!`;

        document.getElementById("recipe-output").innerHTML = recipe;
      };

      document.getElementById("generate-recipe").addEventListener("click", generateRecipe);
    </script>


  </div>
